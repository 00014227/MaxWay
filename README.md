# MaxWay
I implemented the front end of the web page of the famous local fast food cafe MaxWay. 
This website includes 6 pages: the home page where the user can see the menu but functionality, where the ability to choose the product and add to the cart, is not implemented.
The second page is called a branch where the user will able to see all the branches of the cafe, also when the user selects one of the branches, 
then it will redirect to the branch detail page, which contains a map, working hours, and the reference point. Filial pages work dynamically. 
Also, this website contains an “About” and “Contacts” page where the user can find information about the history of the company and find the phone of a call center 
and the telegram bot of the cafe where the users will able to order their meals. And the last page is the Sign-Up page, where the users will able to create their accounts
for orders. They just need to feel their name, email and create a safe password.
